                It's definitely not required, but it makes
                things a lot clearer for a viewer that there
                are dropdown menus in the navigation.

                Or even if they don't know what that little 
                down arrow means, at least they know there's
                something different about those navigation
                items.

                That wraps things up for the demo today!
