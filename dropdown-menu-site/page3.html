                <h3>Meet Hershey</h3>
                <p>
                    Hershey, is a sweet, loving, cuddly boy. Hershey loves to 
                    play in the mud and play tug of war. However, hersheys 
                    favorite thing to do at the moment is curl up and nap. 
                    Hershey, is currently 8 weeks old and up to date on all 
                    vaccines. Hershey is good with all animals and loves 
                    everyone he meets! Come see Hershey today and see if he is 
                    right for your family.

                It's definitely not required, but it makes
                things a lot clearer for a viewer that there
                are dropdown menus in the navigation.

                Or even if they don't know what that little 
                down arrow means, at least they know there's
                something different about those navigation
                items.

                That wraps things up for the demo today!
