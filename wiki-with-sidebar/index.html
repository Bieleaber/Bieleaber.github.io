                <p>
                    Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of 
                    Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a 
                    religious and cultural celebration among billions of 
                    people around the world. A feast central to the liturgical 
                    year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent 
                    (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, 
                    and initiates the season of Christmastide, which 
                    historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates 
                    on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in 
                    many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of 
                    Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, 
                    and forms an integral part of the holiday season 
                    surrounding it.

                <h3 id="s2">Early and midieval Era</h3>
                <p>
                    In the 2nd century, the "earliest church records" indicate 
                    that "Christians were remembering and celebrating the 
                    birth of the Lord", an "observance [that] sprang up 
                    organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary 
                    believers"; although "they did not agree upon a set date".
                     The earliest evidence of Christ's birth being marked 
                    on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354.
                     Liturgical historians generally agree that 
                    this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336. 
                    Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals 
                    given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and 
                    Tertullian, the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, 
                    Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as 
                    the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century.
                    [20] December 25 was the traditional date of the winter 
                    solstice in the Roman Empire, where most Christians 
                    lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti 
                    (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible Sun') had been 
                    held on this date since 274 AD.

                <p>
                    Following the Protestant Reformation, many of the new 
                    denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran 
                    Church, continued to celebrate Christmas. In 1629, the 
                    Anglican poet John Milton penned On the Morning of 
                    Christ's Nativity, a poem that has since been read by many 
                    during Christmastide. Donald Heinz, a professor at 
                    California State University, Chico, states that Martin 
                    Luther "inaugurated a period in which Germany would 
                    produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in 
                    North America. Among the congregations of the Dutch 
                    Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the 
                    principal evangelical feasts.

                <p>
                    Christmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is 
                    a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a solemnity in the 
                    Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the 
                    Anglican Communion. Other Christian denominations do not 
                    rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on 
                    Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian 
                    feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost. As 
                    such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or 
                    Christmas Day church service plays an important part in 
                    the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along 
                    with Easter, is the period of highest annual church 
                    attendance. A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources 
                    found that six in ten Americans attend church services 
                    during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church 
                    of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million 
                    people at Christmas services in 2015.

                <h3 id="s6">Decorations</h3>
                <p>
                    Nativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They 
                    were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, 
                    quickly spreading across Europe. Different types of 
                    decorations developed across the Christian world, 
                    dependent on local tradition and available resources, and 
                    can vary from simple representations of the crib to far 
                    more elaborate sets renowned manger scene traditions 
                    include the colourful Kraków szopka in Poland, which 
                    imitate Kraków's historical buildings as settings, the 
                    elaborate Italian presepi (Neapolitan , Genoese  
                    and Bolognese ), or the Provençal 
                    crèches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta 
                    figurines called santons. In certain parts of the 
                    world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following 
                    the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative 
                    to static crèches. The first commercially 
                    produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, 
                    inspired by paper chains made by children. In 
                    countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is 
                    very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create 
                    the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, 
                    the pieces used to make the representation are considered a
                    valuable family heirloom.

                    The traditional colors of Christmas decorations are red, 
                    green, and gold.[124][125] Red symbolizes the blood of 
                    Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion; green symbolizes 
                    eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which 
                    does not lose its leaves in the winter; and gold is the 
                    first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three 
                    gifts of the Magi, symbolizing royalty.
