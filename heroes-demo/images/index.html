                Crusoe, try to keep the water horse's existence a secret from

                the family's mansion. As Crusoe grows larger, Angus must 
                protect him from those who would want to harm him.

                A young boy, Pete, is found in a forest where he's been living 
                for six year after an accident took his parents' lives. A 
                ranger, Grace, takes him in and asks him how he survived all 
                by himself. He says he had a friend named Elliott and draws a 
                picture of a dragon, saying it's Elliott. Grace takes the 
                picture to her father who claims that years ago he encountered 
                a dragon in the forest. Grace takes Pete back to the forest 
                and he shows her his home and Elliott. A man sees Elliott, and 
                when he tells about his experience and isn't believed, he sets 
                out to capture the dragon to prove it.

                (Colin Farrell), a former star and World War I amputee, to 
                care for Dumbo, a newborn elephant with large ears who is the 
                butt of the circus's jokes. When Holt's children discover that 
                Dumbo can fly, the circus becomes a success, attracting the 
                attention of entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere and aerial artist
