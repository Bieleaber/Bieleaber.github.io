                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <h6>DRESSING:</h6>
               <ol>
                <li>
                    In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, 
                    buttermilk, whole milk, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, 
                    minced garlic, yellow mustard, anchovy paste, dried 
                    parsley, black pepper, and freshly grated parmesan cheese 
                    until smooth and well-combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl, add the shredded rotisserie chicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the homemade Caesar dressing over the chicken and mix 
                    until the chicken is thoroughly coated with the dressing.
                </li>
                <h6>ASSEMBLY AND BAKING:</h6>
                <li>Preheat your oven’s broiler.</li>
                <li>
                    Transfer the chicken and dressing mixture to an oven-safe 
                    baking dish.
                </li>
                 <li>  
                    Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese 
                    evenly over the top of the chicken mixture. Add a dash of 
                    Italian seasoning evenly across the top.
                <li>
                    Place the baking dish under the broiler and broil until 
                    the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 3-5 minutes. Keep a 
                    close eye on it to prevent burning.
                </li>
                <h6>SERVING:</h6>
                <li>Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool slightly.</li>
                <li>
                    Top the broiled dip with the thinly chopped romaine 
                    lettuce, crushed croutons, grated parmesan cheese, and 
                    chopped cooked bacon if using.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drizzle extra Caesar dressing over the top if desired.
                <li>
                    Serve the Caesar Salad Dip warm with your favorite dipping 
                    options like crackers, baguette slices, or vegetable 
                    sticks. Enjoy!
                </li>
